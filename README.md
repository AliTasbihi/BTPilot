# My Automation Tool

A lightweight, early-stage alternative to [Leapwork](https://www.leapwork.com/).

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is an initial version of an automation tool inspired by Leapwork.  
It allows users to design and execute automated workflows through a simple, intuitive interface — **without writing any code**.

Currently, the application features:

- 📋 **Visual Workflow Builder**: Create automation flows using drag-and-drop nodes.
- 🛠️ **Node-Based Architecture**: Each task (e.g., clicking a button, filling a form) is represented as a node.
- ▶️ **Execution Engine**: Seamlessly runs the designed workflows step-by-step.
- 🎥 **Demo**:

## 🔥 Why I Built It

I wanted to create a tool that simplifies the process of automation for non-developers, enabling anyone to automate tasks visually — similar to what Leapwork offers but in a lightweight and customizable way.
